<u><b>Description:</b></u>

VCiicon will be a way to generate a Virtual Console Icon (along with an XML and banner) for an injected game.

This makes them look as good as Nintendo does them, and even uses the same backgrounds and such.

For now you need to install ImageMagick in order to use this. Also, please note that this is a work in progress so not everything's done yet.
